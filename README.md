# Matrix multiplication

## Introduction  

This folder contains the implementation of the sequential and concorrent multiply matrix. Given this, it refers to one of the activities of the 1st unit of the _Concurrent Programming_ discipline taught by dr. Eiji Adachi Medeiros Barbosa Bachelor of Information Technology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (__UFRN__).

## About the concurrent algorithm

For concurrent version, It's was created a thread according compute capability. The rows will be divide by threads and each thread will compute your subset like the sequencial version.  But if the division it's not exact then I will create a thread with all remaning rows
